#**DC’s Legends of Tomorrow**

My favorite television series is DC’s Legends of Tomorrow. It is set in the same universe among other shows such as Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl, Black Lightning, and Batwoman. It aired from 2016 to 2022. It is my favorite because I like shows with time-travel and I like World History and many historical events are tackled in the show. Aside from being the sci-fi/history genre of the show, I like it because it is a superhero series of DC and I liked all the crossovers between the shows of Arrowverse (the name of the shared television universe in The CW). Also, I liked how every character development in the show and how they treat each other as family. There are also several LGBTQIA and also several Black characters and many strong women in the show which is very good.
